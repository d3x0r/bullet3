
btConvexPolyhedron 
contains
		public bool IsAlmostZero( ref btVector3 v )
		
		
EPSILON redefined several places

FLT_MAX  - should be a constant from btScalar  (double/float precision)
-FLT_MAX should be FLT_MIN
FLT_EPISLON should be SIMD_EPSILON

!! ConvexHullComputer should take the standard list of btVector3 not an abstract double[]/float[] 

!! 1e30 should be replaced with constant


------
BulletCollision/BroadphaseCollision/btBroadphaseProxy.cs
in  class btBroadphasePairSortPredicate

is this expression...

&& a.m_algorithm > b.m_algorithm

m_algorithm is  "	mutable btCollisionAlgorithm* m_algorithm;"

There's no operator>  for this... so it's just comparing memory address....

is there some table that keeps instances of these algorithms that the order significant?  Or is it better to just   .... ( a.m_algorithm != b.m_algorithm )
